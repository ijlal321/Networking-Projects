# Networking Projects Repository

Welcome to my Networking Projects Repository! This repository hosts a collection of networking projects, primarily created using Cisco Packet Tracer. Here, I design networks tailored for various environments such as companies, hotels, schools, and homes. 

## About Cisco Packet Tracer
[Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) is a powerful network simulation tool provided by Cisco Systems. It allows users to create network topologies, configure devices, and simulate network behavior. 

## Projects
### Current and Upcomming Projects
- **SOHO Network:** Setting up office network with different departments, Each department with its own network using a single switch and a router .
- **Hotel Wi-Fi Network:** Design and implementation of a Wi-Fi network for a hotel, ensuring coverage and performance for guests and staff.
- **Simple home Network:** Configuring a home network with multiple devices, ensuring connectivity and security for household members.
- **Company Network Design(Upcomming):** A comprehensive network design for a corporate environment, including routers, switches, servers, and security devices.



## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder of your choice.
3. Load the project file (.pkt) into Cisco Packet Tracer to view and simulate the network topology.
4. Explore the configurations and design choices made for each project.
5. Experiment with different scenarios and modifications to deepen your understanding of network design principles.
